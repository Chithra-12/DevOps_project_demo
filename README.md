Welcome to the OpenTelemetry Astronomy Shop Demo

This repository contains the OpenTelemetry Astronomy Shop, a microservice-based distributed system intended to illustrate the implementation of OpenTelemetry in a near real-world environment.

Our goals are threefold:

  *Provide a realistic example of a distributed system that can be used to demonstrate OpenTelemetry instrumentation and observability.

  *Build a base for vendors, tooling authors, and others to extend and demonstrate their OpenTelemetry integrations.

  *Create a living example for OpenTelemetry contributors to use for testing new versions of the API, SDK, and other components or enhancements.
